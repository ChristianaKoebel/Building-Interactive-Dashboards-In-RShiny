# Building-Interactive-Dashboards-In-RShiny

Within any organization, clear and concise communication of data and information is essential for effective strategic planning and informed decision making. Others must be able to quickly get the information they need to make important decisions. One way to do this is to create interactive web applications and present them in a dashboard. Shinydashboard is an R package that allows organizations to develop R Shiny applications, embed them in a dashboard, and publish the dashboard online.

This report discusses the user interface and server components of a shinydashboard, as well as the structure of the dashboard (header, sidebar, and body). Moreover, it examines the flexibility of the dashboard layout and the customization that the Shinydashboard package offers.

An alternative option for creating interactive dashboards, called Flexdashboard, is proposed and compared with Shinydashboard.

The report concludes that Shinydashboard is an excellent software to use to embed R Shiny applications in dashboards since it is user friendly and cost effective, and because it allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards that effectively communicate important information.
